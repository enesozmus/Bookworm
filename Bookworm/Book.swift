/*
    // â†’ The app development skill youâ€™ll be learning is one of Appleâ€™s frameworks: SwiftData. Itâ€™s responsible for managing objects in a database, including reading, writing, filtering, sorting, and more, and itâ€™s hugely important in app development for iOS, macOS, and beyond.
    // â†’ SwiftData is an object graph and persistence framework, which is a fancy way of saying it lets us define objects and properties of those objects, then lets us read and write them from permanent storage.
 
    // â†’ SwiftData makes it easy to persist data using declarative code.
    // â†’ You can query and filter data using regular Swift code.
    // â†’ And itâ€™s designed to integrate seamlessly with SwiftUI.
    // â†’ Model your data using regular Swift types with @Model, with no additional files or tools to manage.
